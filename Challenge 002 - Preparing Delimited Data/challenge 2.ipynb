    "Many products will export textual data with delimiters such as quotes. This is done so that strings can contain delimiters or control characters within them. Having more than one type of delimiter can be hard for ETL programs to interpret.  In the input text file, there are two different delimiters (double quotes, single quotes) and they surround different data types.\n",

    "Use Alteryx or Python to strip out the delimiters as superfluous and format the data as represented in the output."
