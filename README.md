# Alteryx-Challenges-Python
The purpose of this repository is to solve Alteryx weekly challenges in Python. An overview of all challenges can be found [here](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Weekly-Challenge-Index-amp-Welcome/td-p/48275). Alteryx challenges focus on ETL.

Each week the Alteryx community posts a dataset and an accompanying challenge: these can include cleaning the data, XML parsing, API queries, spatial datasets etc. The idea is to become proficient in Alteryx, but any tool can be used to solve those challenges.
