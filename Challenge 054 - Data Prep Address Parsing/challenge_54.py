# This weekâ€™s challenge is to parse out City, State and ZIP code from some unformatted input data. 
# The data is in a nonstandard format - it is missing commas and some city names are two words 
# and some city name are only one word, making parsing a challenge.   
# You need to be able to parse out the city name, state, and zip code if available.

# Source: https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Challenge-54-Data-Prep-Address-Parsing/td-p/44255

Your goal is to create a process that will transform the data into a data table with separated columns for City, State, and ZIP.
